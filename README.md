**CC PowerCore** is a premium, industrial-styled command center for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview). It acts as a visual middleware, routing your local Claude Code CLI traffic through [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/), giving you total control over model selection, budget, and API usage.

## 🚀 Core Purpose
The goal of CC PowerCore is to **unlock the full potential of Claude Code**. By decoupling it from the default Anthropic API, it provides a ritualistic "Ignition" interface to inject OpenRouter configuration into your shell environment. This means you can drive the official Claude Code CLI with **any model** (Gemini, GPT, GLM, etc.).

## 👥 Target Audience
- **Geek Developers**: People who want to use non-standard models (like `deepseek-r1`, `claude-3-5-sonnet` legacy, etc.) in Claude Code.
- **Cost-Conscious Users**: Engineers who want to monitor session costs in real-time ($0.00000) and optimize AI spending.
- **Minimalists**: Those who find config files tedious but dislike complex GUIs.

## ⚡ Use Cases
1.  **Freedom to Switch**: Want to use **Gemini 1.5 Pro** for coding? Just switch it on the console, and your `claude` command will use it instantly.
2.  **Visualized Cost**: View real-time session consumption on the dashboard.
3.  **On-Demand Toggle**: Turn off the router to seamlessly return Claude Code to the default Anthropic API.
